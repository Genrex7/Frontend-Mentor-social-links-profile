## My process

### Built with

- ![HTML][html]
- ![CSS][css]
- ![Tailwind CSS][tailwind-css]
- ![Google fonts][google-fonts]
- ![Flexbox][flexbox]
- ![Mobile-first workflow][mobile-first-workflow]

### What I learned

1.  Tailwind CSS Utility-First Workflow: Tailwind CSS introduced me to a utility-first approach where styles are applied directly in the HTML markup using pre-defined classes. Some key takeaways:

    - Rapid prototyping with utility classes like `flex`, `items-center`, `bg-grey-800`, etc.
    - Custom spacing using classes like `p-6`, `gap-4`, and `rounded-xl`.
    - Responsive design with breakpoint-based classes like `md:w-[24rem]`.

    - This made styling extremely fast without having to write custom CSS (except for custom themes or colors, which were configured in the Tailwind config).

2.  Responsive Design: I learned to build for different screen sizes using Tailwindâ€™s responsive design syntax:

    ```html
    <section class="w-[20rem] 425px:w-[24rem]"></section>
    ```

    This approach allowed me to quickly adapt layouts for small screens while maintaining a clean desktop layout.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS - DOCS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - This helped me understand how to use tailwind css for styling the html page.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - A great resource for importing fonts easily and making text look unique.
